<h1>posterbe.com are jerks</h1>
<p>They're selling people's copyrighted work without permission. Filing a 
DMCA request with them almost certainly does nothing, as their business is 
built on scams. We should report them to their webhost, CloudFlare, and 
their payment processor, PayPal. Interrupting their hosting and ability to 
do business is the best way to combat this fraud.</p>
