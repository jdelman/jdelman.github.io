<p><i>note: this interview
was conducted over the course of a couple of months, the process began around
the time</i> <i>the blimp went up before the release of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141110222421/http://warp.net/records/aphex-twin/syro" target="_blank">Syro</a>&nbsp;and
 was completed on 25.10.2014, after the albums release.&nbsp;some 
questions were inserted afterwards, answered amended etc, so the whole 
thing isn't sequential.&nbsp;all music tracks, photo's &amp; images have
 been supplied by richard + photo's that were taken by other people have
 been noted. this is <b>part two</b> of two parts. </i><i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141110222421/http://noyzelab.blogspot.com.au/2014/11/syrobonkers-part1.html" target="_blank">-----&gt; part one is HERE!</a> </i><br>

	<b>dave: so much for the synth nerding, would u like to briefly say 
anything particular about each of the other tracks/ album as a 
whole/track selection?</b><br>
		
<br>
	
rich: dunno, too much too think about overall<br>
		
but they were all pretty much done on new studio setups Id just made, so
 I was pretty much warming up on the setups with those, doesnt mean I 
wasnt really happy with them but as always with new setups, takes a 
while to get going before you can attempt to large it up, the fucker is i
 usually tear em down again before mastering them..<br>
		
Saying that , when it works , I really like the vibe of trying out new 
bits of klob or setups, I relish pretty much all states of mind , so all
 good in long term.<br>
		
The first 3 tracks were actually made in order 3,1,2 after taking 3 
years to make that particular studio, I mean when its taken that long to
 put something together and you finally kneel before it , its pretty 
intense wot u do first.<br>
		
Other setups used only took a matter of hours to put together and then 
grew really quickly, like most of my setups do, like bacteria.<br>
		
When choosing the tracks, I went for easy listening/lushness on syro which is pretty friendly for me.<br>
		
Ive been putting things out long enough to know pretty much what reactions will be.<br>
		
If I go for experimental then you only make about 20% fans happy, 80% get alienated and you won't win many new listeners.<br>
		
Syro I rek will be other way around, it needed to be done about now, 
then I can put out more challengin stuff, I really like the tracks, so 
absolutely not selling out or anyfing, kind of stick neck out a little 
bit into mainstream and then go away again, Im just not mental enough to
 go fully mainstream, would have to deal with so much shit that would 
detract from what I want to do, otherwise Id go for it, but being 
recognized etc makes me feel massively uncomfortable but at same time, 
the world is awash with commercial bullshit, so gotta try and twat some 
of that stuff out the way.<br>
		
<br>
	<b>dave: what (if any) were your main influences (e.g. musically, 
philosophically, etc.) for this album or any of the traks specifically??
 and anything you want to say about the production?</b><br>

rich: I thought id be brave and release stuff that I thought could 
possibly be digested by the mainstream without any artistic compromise 
whatsoever.<br>
		
All the tracks I picked from the many that I have stockpiled are my fave
 tunes I've been listening over the last couple of years so I absolutely
 know which tunes I'm selecting are the right ones, I mean I know there 
is no perfect selection, as soon as I made it I wanted to change it but 
that would happen everyday I sat down to compile it, id be in a 
different moodmode few hours<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>and so the selection will always be a bit different.<br>
		
But its near enough right, good enough I spent longer making most of the
 tracks than I ever did before, even most of the ones on drukqs, the 
time setting up all that analog klobber is ridiculous, keeping it 
working and in tune etc,<br>
		
there were no analogues runnin live on druqks at all, I mostly have 2-3 
backups of most of my gear so when it breaks i can replace it while the 
others get fixed which can sometimes take years, so its the only way if 
you want to use this much old analogues.<br>
		
Some tracks took a year on /off to make and lots of things broke in that
 time inc the 3300's , 2 chroma's , 2 code8's etc etc, its a total 
fucking nightmare but when its finished the satisfaction is immense.<br>
		
When you have 64+ channels of vintage equipment as was the case in some 
of the tracks especially track2, there is A LOT of noise generated, I 
used A LOT of noise gates, my fave being some EMT ones which are like 
LPF/gate hybrids, they have that lush LPF roll off rather than a volume 
fade, very sexual.to my eears<br>
		
But I use several different types,<br>
		
none of the tracks on syro were multi tracked into the computer , they 
were all recorded live to 2 track, which is kinda insane but the way i 
like it.<br>
		
Its done then , you have to get it right , theres no fixing it 
afterwards, theres no edits on any of the tracks apart from the Marchrom
 , which is made from multiple takes with a load of different Eventide 
3000 dse fx.<br>
		
A fuck load of time was spent trying out things to see what worked with 
what, way too much time in fact for those particular tracks, Ive done 
tracks recently in hours that I like as much but in a different way, I 
still like spending yonks on things these days.<br>
		
Ive been trying to combine recently the nrg u have when your 15 with the
 knowledge you gain when your 42, by having the right setups, getting 
there..<br>
		
i think i have as much nrg now as i did when a teen but when ur a teen 
ur more narrowminded so your effort goes into a tighter space, as ive 
got older just get into so many things it spreads your concentration<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>.But
 i always think i wish i knew this or that when i was 15 its dumb to 
think like that coz u can just fix it in the present, there is only 
present anyway, future/past just a mind construct, i worked tht out on 
shrooms when i was 19 :)<br>
		
Oh but on the noise gates, yes there are lots of them but obviously I 
still love hiss at the right level in the right places, even more so in 
these days of ultra clean linear itb recordings.<br>
		
controlling it to the right degree is tricky,.<br>
		
Ive been using an old 70s rack of allison research ones, 10 of the 
buggers,with the funny little mystical head logo at the top, i sent you 
some links to it, they're all discreet and each one has its own sound 
and distorts differently, the compressors are not as snappy as the later
 ones which i love [ gain brain2], one of my fave compressors that, they
 have a lush 70s sound though , the discreet ones, although you can 
tweak the trimpots on the pcb to get different responses, been doing 
that a lot recently.<br>
		
They have weird annoyin connectors on the back, forgot the name of dem.<br>
		
Oh and on trak 6, the whole track is going thru a drawmer stereo gate which is being triggered by sequenced sounds.<br>
		
I really wanted to do it like that and gate the whole friggin track but 
disadvantage was that the whole track then sounds like the drawmer+the 
hedroom on dem things aint that great, you can hear it breaking up, 
bummer but i liked the roughness also.<br>
		
Ive got a much better earlier version which sounds quite a bit nicer 
although i wasnt using any fancy mixers on that one so not that nice but
 its an earlier version so not quite as developed OR gated 
obviously...unfort..i would attach it but can't find it right now...<br>
		
might stick it up online somewhere when/if i do though.<br>
		
<br>

	<br>
	
rich:this is not it actually as its still being gated but there u go.<br>
		
some people have said to me, do you make your tracks slow and then speed
 them up, which is funny to me, answer is no, the vibe would be totally 
different if you did that, Ive tried it, doesnt work for me, it would 
sound sped up, I make them at the speed they are, of course I do stare 
at and enter data in, speed set to zero , ha but thats it, tracks like 
mt sain michel st micahels mount off drukqs, im surprised i didnt have a
 heart attack when makin those tracks, i know i was in a total rush 
state for the entire time of making tracks like those, especially that 
one!<br>
		
But the idea that I have sped them up is funny because why would i want 
to do that? to make it seem more complex than it is? to make me feel 
more hectic than i was when making it?<br>
		
nah , it be would be fake.<br>
		
<br>
	
some of the syro tracks are pretty old and some are made in the last 6 
months, the Japanese bonus one is the newest although that is very 
different from all the other ones I've been doing recently, it was a 
weird one off that fitted very nicely on the end of syro or anywhere 
where people want to insert it for that matter.<br>
		
Its my wife speaking in russian , sampled into ensoniq asr10 and run 
thru vocoders...can't rem wot the carrier was though...oh yeah it was 
ps3200, sennheiser vsm<br>
		
<br>
	<a name="more"></a><br>
	<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Mine and my families 
privacy is VERY important to me and deciding to thwart myself into the 
mainstream was not an easy decision, I'm not doing it for the money, ive
 already got enough 4us2 live on for a bit, I just wanted to put music 
out there in the mainstream which has been made for the right reasons, 
coz its definitely in short fucking supply!<br>
		
The same doesn't go for underground electronic music which imo has been 
at an all time high for years now, theres sooo much good stuff com in 
out now its totally inspiring and an amazing time to be listening to 
stuff, i should compile a chart here or something, I'm going to be 
putting a/v mixes online with my mate eno[weirdcore]<br>
		
<br>
	<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141110222421/http://weirdcore.tv/" target="_blank">http://weirdcore.tv/</a><br>
		
<br>
	
soon hopefully soonish<br>
		
like mix tapes but with visuals, really looking fwd, gunna be doing all 
different styles there from funk to musique concrete and all in between,
 inc loads of newshit by others.<br>
	I had been waiting for years for it to get good and now theres just 
sooo many good producers out there with no equipment, just 
puter&amp;pair of speakers<br>
		
absolutely has kicked off now and its only going to get better I reckon.<br>
		
<br>
	
2nd answer is the whole purpose of me making music is to 
reorganise/rearrange/modify me into something else, everything you 
experience affects/changes you / adjusts your chemistry,/makes new 
connections in yer brain, allows you to notice new things, especially 
sound and music but sound or vibration is potentially the most powerful 
influence.<br>
		
When you hear natural sounds, you can feel how it deeply affects you but
 apart from putting yourself into those situations you are at the mercy 
of whatever happens in those environments.<br>
		
A good thing about travelling, although I don't really like physically travelling that much.<br>
		
When you make music, or orchestrate natural phenomena you are putting 
together something that you know or should know is going to rearrange 
you and change you in a more defined way than if you just went to 
another country you never went to before, then when you create it and 
experience it you become what you wanted to be and it feeds back to what
 you want to become again, its the lushest spiral of creativity and it 
can be taken much further than music is currently doing [i personally 
STILL feel like I'm just warming up!], I think with sound alone, you can
 potentially rearrange all matter and change the way you and others 
think, if its sequenced correctly.<br>
		
pretty much everyting is vibration.<br>
		
But you have to be open to it.<br>
		
if you think thats bullshit then you have a lot to learn :) I'm not talking to you dave.<br>
		
I love how the rhythmic energy from a sequencer or 1 single frequency 
can actually give you nrg when you listen to it, nrg from the electrical
 power supply transferred to our bodies through sound, its different to a
 human playing a musical instrument, that is a direct nrg transfer from 
one to another/s, you are at the mercy then of how much nrg they have to
 give.<br>
		
Controlling electricity which you pay for or generate from the sun or other means and transferring it to your body is<br>
		
amazing, sometimes<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I feel so honoured that there is this massive electricity supply that we can just tap into without having to work for it.<br>
		
:) as well having enough food to eat.<br>
		
I do think the world is absolutely fucked and most people on earth are 
under control to a large extent, the world is so fucking boring as well 
as obviously<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>being evil, life could be SOOO much better, we r controlled by the most boring cunts imaginable.<br>
		
The potential of human beings is immense and that is why people are kept
 under such tight control because the controllers know what we are 
capable of.<br>
		
<br>
	Also like i mention below with tunings, mankind needs as much 
positive/trippy/awakening/next level non dark thought provoking 
&nbsp;vibes as possible right now, we are living in a mega dark 
spiritual age and its 2easy to channel that into our music but I think 
we have to try really hard to drag ourselves out of it and dream up new 
mind expanding music &amp; art, thats definitely not boring nu age 
yawnsville.<br>

	<b>dave: ultra-thanks for sending thru the cover with the klobber

dots allocate to the tracks, reminds me of cellular automata type </b><b>stuff,
 and player piano roll / punched tape etc. so that's jee'd me up to ask 
some more klob q's. there's some tasty reverb's listed, what's your 
favourite all time reverb box &amp; what got you into reverb as an 
effect?</b><br>
		
<br>
	
rich: i veer more towards the electro mechanical types, so plates, springs,pipes, spaces and gold foil etc.<br>
		
They are so easy to make yourself as well, with just thin sheet metal, 
piezo pickups etc and can use as microphones, will sound more 
interesting than any mic you can buy imo.<br>
		
contact mic on thin sheet metal, job done, more interesting than expensive mice, although they have their place.<br>
		
My wife and me made an amazing slinky spring reverb last year, I think 
it was about 20 slinky springs joined together, suspended around the 
house, sending sounds down that, snippet attached.<br>

<b>+ just built some new ultralong wires this year for our wired open 
day, we used these massive bridge timbers from a local railway bridge 
that got replaced, they over 100 years old, heavy as fuk too! need to do
 a blogpost on them at some point as well. love the sound of the slinky 
stuff, +reminds me bit of some of wire sounds, did u take any pics of 
that setup?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></b><br>
<br>
rich: nah, I'm so shit at remembering to take pics of what i do.<br>
I replaced the garden hoses inside a urei time cube with different 
copper tubes, its soo good, I think the original designer stipulated 
that but urei used garden hose to save money.<br>
<br>
Saying that though, got some long lengthsflexi plastic tubing +hoover 
tubes,few months back, old headphone speaker in one end, mic at the 
other, awesome, sounded especially good feeding back on itself.<br>
<br>
With the digital ones, I didnt get a lexicon 480L til a few years ago, 
mainly coz of price and everyone in old studios has one but they are 
f'kin amazing in the right hands..,&amp; the original Quantec 
qrs[attached example],<br>
<br>

  <br>
<br>
and of course the Eventide H3000 d/se are absolutely mental lush 
devices, those ones in particular really envelop the sound rather than 
tack it on, special blessed bits of equipment.<br>
<br>
Of course special mentions have to go to akg 68k [so lushlygrainy and 
some nice granular features],quadraverb, quadraverb is dark and muddy 
and has nice arrangement of subtle pitch shifting, delays into reverbs 
etc, can be setup very nicely if you spend the time with it, used on all
 tracks on SAW1.<br>
but can be recreated with other units quite easily but thyre cheap as , so..<br>
just did a quik test on QVerb last week here, this is just din sync 
dr110+quadraverb , circlon, so u can hear quadraverb in bit diff light, 
not got many files on this laptop.<br>

<b>dave: great little trk! alesis did good with tht quadraverb, they 
must have made millions of em! it was well popular, always quite liked 
the buttons on it too. </b><br>
<br>
rich: Then Publison DHM 89 pitch shifter [not reverb]with KB200 blew me 
away, it was pretty much the first sampler and does super stereo 
rudimentary granular synthesis, man if id had one of those in the 80's !<br>
I dont think many people released anything using the granular fucntions 
on that apart from maybe 1 electro record and Parmagiani.<br>
So many more boxes, thyre all good in their own way.<br>
id love to write a book on my fx boxes..<br>
im super interested in computer emulations of springs also, thyre 
getting awesome now, something about springs...time warpers, 
&lt;&lt;&lt;they are to audio what prisms are to light !&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

interface on the back of the synton was specially designed for hooking 
up to pooter for analysis/resynthesis, its do-able ... :) cripes, i 
could talk about this all day, .. anyway u were saying about synton ...</b><br>
<br>
rich: yeah i thought you prob could, ok save it for when i interview you<br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>:)<br>
<br>
I mean I suppose the main thing to do there is recording the cv outs 
from the filters of analysed audio, manipuating the voltages with a seq 
then chuck in it back at the vocoder, did try this a few times with a 
doepfer setup, theres definitly plenty of scope their for future 
experiments, give me a clone please someone?<br>
also check this out on the dutch speech synthesis tip, i got it from 
Steim about 15 years ago, VOSIM voice simulation sound synthesis,<br>
iits based on the idea that by employing repeating tone-burst signals of
 variable pulse duration and variable delay, a sound output of high 
linguistic and musical expressive power can be obtained :)<br>
<br>
reminds me of in school as a kid when bored in lessons id make that 
clicking flange sound you can do with your mouth, which usually ended up
 in getting a detention.<br>
<br>
"i will not make and/or incite others to make repetitive weird clicking flange sound with my voice" x200<br>

that steim vosim box looks mentox! yea i know bout the vosim o course, 
been into that bak in bt labs hushhush days again... got my first vosim 
tweak in late 80's/early 90s. i got 4 boxes here that do it, someone 
ought to get on that tip and make something for euro that does it! the

<br>
rich: yeah super top, 1/4 tone, 1/8 tone i used quite a bit on SAW2<br>
well my versions of them, tweaked.<br>
<br>
<b>dave: what microtuning did u use on syro ??</b><br>
<br>
rich: I made some of my own up on zithers,piano, scala for sysex dumps 
into circlon and some other h-pi software, its quite subtle on syro, i 
didnt choose any of the far out ones yet for release.<br>
got quite a few microtonal keyboards like their bigger ones<br>
peeps can prob find me on circlon list as I've been pecking Colin for 
ages to implement a microtune editor for analogues on there!<br>
He finally put scala import on there which was a hidden feature for a while , while i was making the end of syro,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>actually<br>
but we, yes we the people REALLY need colin to b able to save the 
goddamn tuning tables on there and be able to tweak them intuitively on 
the fly!!!<br>
when he does that ill be happy for next 10 years<br>
<br>
talking of circlon which I'm pretty much always up for doing these days,<br>
some of my mates were freaked out I made jungle tracks on the circlon 
inc. trk11 on syro, I just got so deep into circlon , when i first got 
it , i didn't know how far i could go with it but I'm like a shorthand 
typist on that thing now, timing is beautiful, its really re-trained my 
brain, seriously, now i can hear even more accurately like within 1ms i 
reckon.<br>
its so funny controlling lappy from the circlon which it can do without 
blinking, love it, can control the computer better than the computer can
 control itself!<br>
it is the best sequencer ever made til now, in terms of analogue i/o, 
timing man that box...its got a long way to go but I can't endorse it 
enough ! I've never been into endorsing anything, I've been asked by a 
lot of people but i hate the idea of it, makes my skin crawl, there can 
be good combos for sure between artist and maker but when its too 
business it all goes wrong, people gotta make a living but you can tell 
easily when people got their priorities wrong anyhow, anyway colin is 
totally on it and in it for the right reasons.<br>
i hope colin does really well out of it, he deserves to , guys a genius and he's got my gx1 still for midi -ing!<br>
but at the mo id rather he kept o.s updates flowing:)<br>
you have to b extra mental to have a many synth /osc setup AND try to 
make microtonal tracks AND still try and get them all intune, ha its 
insanity but it can be done, its top i love it.<br>
<br>
<b>dave: are there any programs in particular u find useful for 
microtuning e.g. scala, h-pi ? and can u tell me wot u think of them and
 any improvements u think they could do with ??</b><br>
<br>
rich: im interested in the purely mathematical tunings yes and 
especially ones that I make up as opposed to ones already out there but 
much more interested in making my own ones up on a per session basis/per
 track ,intuitively, rather than with maths but I've learned a lot from 
listening to certain mathematical ratios, fascinating.<br>
its easy to make your own maths ones up also, scala is a deep prog but u can get hed around it with a bit of effort.<br>
but yeah creating them intuitively really is where its at or maybe starting off with a preset ratio/scale and tweaking it.<br>
<br>
i like to use different scales, depending on where i want to go<br>
in a particular trak,<br>
things like buchla controllers, make it so easy to make your own, in a 
matter of seconds whereas on computer, other methods, can be like 
banging you ed against a brickwall, like dx7 e! as u just found out 
yerself, although they r not so bad if you know where u r going with 
them but things like the e! are totally crap for trying out new stuff, i
 do love tht E! board though, im like a little kid with addons like 
that.<br>
<br>
i mainly now use loads of oberheim marion pro synths/msr2's as I think those 2r<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>the only ? analogue polysynths with FULL micro tuning,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>idont
 think there were any others to have FULL micro tuning, how insane is 
that! its beyond belief to me..i contact new manufacturers like dave 
smith, p5 had a bit of microtungin buried in it but zilch after that.<br>
theyre not the best sounding synths but they r madly flexible and the ui
 is pretty amazing considering how few buttons it has, its fully usable,
 i don't find it frustrating to use at all actually, without a sysex 
editor.<br>
<br>
guitar music freaks me out , coz i look at a guitar, i bought one couple
 years ago, ha , coz i thought it was about only instrument i didnt have
 lying around the house.<br>
and think why the fuck do people stick to 12TET, its ultra boring and 
guitars like most stringed instruments beg to be re-tuned, its so easy 
compared to most synths,<br>
to me a synth/plug in or &nbsp;whatever that doesn't allow you to change
 the tuning scale is like only having one demo song that you have to use
 in every track, or painting on a canvas and having to always use the 
same background colour ,drives me nuts that most people have not woke up
 to micro tuning yet, i predict 80% of all electronic music will be 
microtonal in a few years., i fuckig hope so anyhow<br>
again, Mankind is at a spiritual low point right now, possibly the 
lowest its ever been if you read into the great pyramid inscriptions, 
its not hard to see either, most people are very much asleep and being 
controlled.<br>
That doesnt mean that everyone is asleep, many others are ultra awake 
and hopefully the numbers are going to rise, they better do anyhow and 
quickly before we lose all our civil liberties.<br>
its like all these dub step/jungle tracks that are trying to sound dark but using fluffy old 12TET, just hilarious<br>
i think its subconsciously why all the artists that dont microtune work 
in the bass region , sub bass like in jungle etc, the brain finds it 
harder to decern pitch the lower you go, so if your going to use 12TET 
then go for the lower frequencies, people are going lower and lower all 
the time due mainly to monitoring systems getting better but i also 
think spiritually people are going to those lower notes as they are 
almost non12TET sounding, once people get it , it will kik off and 
spread be a major revolution in electronic music, .<br>
Ive been using microtonal stuff mainly since selected ambient works2 on /off but did use it prior to that quite a bit also.<br>
<br>
<b>dave: yea, I did classical piano for 10 years, up until 1981, did rsm
 grades and that, but by then I was already well into punk/electronic 
music/synths &amp; building things. so I gave up piano and 12tet, and 
moved to synths + electronics and started makin me own trax &amp; setup 
me studio. also i agree the utuning software needs to be more intuitive,
 I've started making tunings algorithmically using ca since last year, 
not based on any music theory, so kinda intuitive from the point of view
 of artificial life :) i still like so called "classical" music tho, if 
its done well, especially harpsichord coz they all get their own 
tunings, which are often quite weird + i always think ladies play 
harpsichord better than blokes, at least wot i;ve heard.</b><br>

 also really wrote some good stuff, he was such a total d00d!!! he wrote
 &amp; recorded so much microtonal stuff! well he called it xentonality,
 coz it covered more like the micro &amp; macrotonality. i got tons of 
his stuff, used to be on the web but for some reason the whole of the

must be a new site somewhere... or on wayback machine,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>but there is a little article on him here :</b><br>

<br>
<b>he probably had the worlds most serious beard as well!</b><br>
<br>
rich: Yeah seen xenharmonics crop up a lot , top word. tbh Im not very 
good at reading about music theory, or about learning anything in 
general, from anyone, I've really tried recently , its interesting but 
to me always seems like homework.<br>
I was really terrible in school, I literally could never bring myself to
 listen to anything anyone said, I'm not much different now, in school I
 used to just stare at the teachers listening to every tiny 
characteristic of their voices , inflections etc, trying to work out 
what was going on in their brains<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>which usually was not a lot but not hearing hardly a single word they said.<br>
i think I'm a bit aurally dyslexic or something because sometimes i 
can't understand anything anyone is going on about..just sounds like 
words/pitches with no patterns/gibberish<br>
...<br>
partially coz most of what we were taught was so utterly pointless and 
designed imo to put you off the interesting stuff to do with maths etc<br>
<br>
and how not to evaluate anything being said to you or how to think.<br>
which should be the first lesson in all education, how to evaluate what your being told!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>starting with why you should you be told 'how to evaluate what your being told' :)<br>
I loved being in school though, had such a laff, kind of more fun when all the teachers r fukheads, unites people.<br>
<br>
<b>dave: do u work out your own tunings and can u say anything about 
that? I notice on the cover klob it sez zither afx-scale, can u 
elaborate on that?</b><br>
<br>
rich: its as easy as just turning your tuning screws to where it sounds right to where you want to go<br>
I love re-working tunings like you can copy and paste prests/patches on a
 synth , copying and developing/refining them as the years go by.<br>
<br>
<b>dave: are any of those wicked unreleased trax u sent me over the years on the album? is it ok if i play any of em to my missus?</b><br>
<br>
rich: ha yeah fine, not sure cant remem if they r on there prob not.<br>
<br>
<b>dave: some of em got similar names in my afx incoming folder over the
 years: ages ago u sent me a casio fz timestretch thing called 
"casiofz10m pseudo timestretch" has u talking, and then some drum stuff.
 also CIRCLONT14+4 but mite b diff version? don't seem to b any others 
with similar titles tho now i chkd.</b><br>
<br>
<b>theres also a lot of speculation about melodies from mars, b cool if u
 could say anything about the making of this &amp; any release plans.</b><br>
<br>
rich: particular period around 94, made in 36 clissold crescent north 
london, dont think you ever lived there? im sure u went there though?<br>
a lot of mates/mates of mates lived there<br>
memory is a bit hazy/smodged of that decade !-)<br>
I made ICBYD, RDJ, half of SAW2 etc etc there, amazing good times.<br>
<br>
<b>dave: yea top vibes, i lived at 36 clissold for a while (about 6 
months, well i still had my place in suffolk, so used to flit back &amp;
 forth...), but was jus after u left an got the bank, late 90's i tink 
prob 98 or 99! hazytimez 4 sure! I lived in the tiny room near the door 
over the stairs, damo got a vid of me setup in there once... there was

rich: well if you get a modern mouse,flatscreen cable converters+midex 
midi expander then ur cookin on gas,+hxc! its funny i forgot on cubase 
on there how bloody slow it does screen redraws, i used quite a bit of 
software on that back in the day like dr t's<br>
and loads of algorhytmic midi things and editors of course, which is 
what i still use it for, fave being a Kawai K5 editor but there are some
 awesome dx ones, that sort sounds via harmonicity etc<br>
i did a ardkore tune on it recently with tx16W :) and also forgot the timing is affected when you move the mouse!<br>
you can do swing by rhythmically swiping the mouse up n down the screen !<br>
not properly check ST emulators with editors, &nbsp;but apparently they do work, on the 2dolist.<br>
<br>
<b>dave: i can vouch for steem on the pc, wish they would get one going

<br>
ive attached some more pics of jh units that i bought from him, i kept buying his prototypes, allowed him to keep<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>building
 better versions and building more new stuff , he was SO quick at making
 stuff , incredible dude, that ps3200 clone he made, fuk me!<br>
the phaser in circlon14 is the arp phaser in this pic, being externally controlled,<br>
Was super top that i got that from him as i used to have an arp quadra 
and indeed the phaser on those beasts is lovely but the synth is just so
 huge, super rich sound though..and watch them overhanging keys! never 
seen one midi'd<br>
on another note , a lot of tracks on syro have more sounds than the 
equipment used as i utilized A LOT of program changes, each synth 
responds at diff speeds to pgm changes so a lot of time id have to 
program a pgm change on the preceding bar of something otherwise the 
start note would get cut off.<br>
But on things like the korg ps3200 and cs80 you can do near instant pgm 
chnges, and so u can make them like wavetable synths, cs80 looks 
especially awesome when you sweep all the presets back &amp; fwd knight 
rider style while playing all the sounds consecutively.<br>
Trouble is when you go to a diff pgm sound, u usually want to eq that 
differently, so in more recent traks after syro where ive used a lot of 
pgm changes ive bothered to route the output into an audio matrix 
switcher so when i switch programs the sequencer will simultaneously 
route the audio to another eq!<br>
fucking A N A L! never would have done that when i was 16.<br>

you can setup resonant chords with multiple eq bands then shift the 
chords around with a keyboard input :) , noyce.<br>
I also asked them to put portamento on it but<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>krystof
 said there would be no point, ha, wrong! i think he was not stoned 
enough though..next time mate, cant wait as that would be a dope 
feature.<br>
really annoys me when parametric eqs hard or soft dont have completely overlapping bands, boring!<br>
yeah that sm pro one is Vgood VFM.<br>
other faves are cwejman, klark teknik dn410 there r other eurocrak ones on horizon swell<br>
<br>
<b>dave: tongue drums sound interesting, can u tell me more about it?</b><br>
<br>
rich: oh yeah got loads of them, made my own as well, didn't quite get 
the tuning right though but close, coincidence my missuz just strted 
playing one while i was typing!<br>
just thought bout this funny london? expression 'her in doors' in my case its 'him in doors' :))))<br>
<br>
<b>dave: we've chatted about mixing desks lots over the years, on 
thealbum u've used quite a range e.g. ultra cheap boss bx8 to the neotek
 elite 64 channel custom. its interesting that u use mixers a lot in 
your work, and u've also said to me about how u consider them 
instruments, particular regarding no-input mixer type stuff. did u use 
mixers in unusual ways on the album &amp; can u tell me about that? 
&nbsp;wot draws u to use such a range of mixer/pre-amp/channel strip 
klob?</b><br>
<br>
rich: mixers are prob my fave pieces of electronic equipment, theyre like whole worlds onto themselves<br>
ive done pretty well in not buying loads, ive been tempted and not collected them but ive got a few<br>
the custom neotek one ive got is 128 channels and pretty epic but quite 
easy to use, it does have a few headscratching features on it which took
 me a while to get me edaround, i rem printing out and reading several 
old SSL manuals in a couple of days, phew before i had mine built and 
modified<br>
I think neotek had the dual channel thing going on b4 ssl though.<br>
<br>
one feature out of quite a few that i wanted which i didnt get on my 
neotek or ADT was to have a SiP fade feature, so you can press the 
special AFXSiP button , then the balance between the SiP and main mix 
can be controlled by a crossfader pot, shweet. but was too much hassle 
for them to implement.<br>
The ADT guy Gert is amazing, anything you want, he will be like ya ya, no problem, i love germans.<br>
their website is off the hook, get lost in that for hours.<br>
my ADT mixer kiks major ass, so compact, its a hybrid rack mixer to fit 
into my cray setup :) ultra compact i use several additional matrix 
mixers with it now, its growing!<br>
just got another midas xl88, love those, rare as rocking horse shit, cheers heck for tipoff!<br>
ADT is a modular mixer, there are different eq's etc on pretty much 
every channel, &nbsp;so much tone variety, cv's in the patch bay, its 
nowhere as easy to use as the neotek though, idea was basically to have 
an ultra clean mixer with diff variety of tone colours on each channel, 
so I can have tube sound on some, gritty dirty sound on others like from
 the bx8 etc, love it , such a huge range of sound im getting out of it,
 barely scratched the surface so far.<br>
<br>
<b>dave: I see wildlife get a mention on the klob list, can u tell me wot sort of wildlife, &amp; how wild woz it!?</b><br>
<br>
rich: the birds in the piano track! I actually made that track a lot 
better technically but when i recorded it originally, it was a super 
spesh time in my life and those birds were part of it so i just had to 
go with that recording of it, straight to nagra tape, love the sound of 
pianos to tape.<br>
<br>
<b>dave: LPG on trk list is tht the Pittsburgh modular jobby?</b><br>
<br>
rich: doepfer, its not as nice as the buchla ones but its what i was using at the time,<br>
theres no buchla on syro at all actually.<br>
<br>
<b>dave: no ems either, yea, thts surprising , u must have some lined 
up! i got a little vid somewhere u sent me when i first got over to oz 
of u prodding one of ya buchla's, was v good, must try an find tht vid, !
 </b><br>
<br>
<b>is there anyone alive u aint worked with who u really want too? is 
there anyone dead u aint worked with who u really want too (would 
require time/matter/interdimensional transportation bizzo)?</b><br>
<br>
rich: nice q, would love to do a track with florian schneider, gerald 
donald, he's got 2 first names like me, derrick may!,stockhausen,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>really
 sad i didn't work with him before he died but he told me last time i 
met him that we would work together so , it will be in another realm, 
&nbsp;i sort of felt that when he said it anyhow.<br>
the stockhasuen vs aphex thing was reported very in accurately btw, I 
have huge, greatest respect for that man possible and I got on with him 
very well, the work ethic of that geezer...bloody hell.<br>
he is from sirius by the way,<br>
oh who else...<br>
man i would work with everyone and anyone who i got on with , i don't 
have to like someones music to wanna work with them, just have to get on
 with them personally and be friends first, i cant do tracks like oh u 
email this ill email that , not into it, too business, like having a 
phone in a studio.<br>
got a few things in pipeline with relatively unknown bands .<br>
<br>
<b>dave: how do u mum&amp;dad feel about being on the album &amp; did they know u were recording them?</b><br>
<br>
rich: i dont think they heard it yet, ive made sample banks from my folks, need to do more actually,,<br>
i love the formant relationship of voices from the same families, studied that quite a bit, fascinating.<br>
i if you like someones voice its as important as their smell, it means 
you are a good genetic match, if you sing the same note as the opposite 
human sex and overlay voices on top of each other the formants should be
 in a harmonious pattern, but you will know that anyhow by intuition to 
help produce healthy children, well thats my theory.<br>
<br>
<b>dave: can u say something about the recording rooms listed? bank room thin? </b><br>
<br>
rich: in my old bank, it was on the first floor, sometimes buses would 
stop outside my house and i would be staring at people through the 
window really close, my mate ian said he saw me once in the studio from 
the bus!<br>
I had several rooms mic'd up as reverbs from there and did whole tracks 
by just feeding rooms into other rooms via delays and frequency 
shifters, monitors and mic's, still to be released.<br>
<br>
<b>dave: basement?</b><br>
<br>
rich: its where i keep my &lt;hat&gt; &nbsp;plate reverbs, synthi100 ,phillips tape echo and turntable encoding setup.<br>
not many people would know or probably care but i used to take and still
 take the utmost care in encoding all my vinyl to computer for djin on 
the computer or just listening in the car etc.<br>
just so they sound as good as possible over the system.<br>
i usually clean all records to save wear on pricey stylus on sme turntable etc<br>
i miss the basement in my old bank, amazing reinforced concrete walk in 
vaults, hugely reverberant, recorded many things in there, it was also 
haunted, vault opened itself once and the taps were left on maximum had 
to use a monkey wrench to turn them off, had to try hard for it not to 
creep me out.<br>
how mental is that, nobody could have got in....so weird..<br>
, it was a very creepy place, now there is a 22 storey block of flats 
there, on top of it, i bet they had a hard time getting those vaults 
out, reinforced concrete 5ft thick..<br>
<br>
<b>dave: thts creeptastic! actually i had a funny ting happen while we 
working on this interview recently. my dx7e had some screws loose in the
 back, one morning i got up and they were all tightened...<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>weird day followed ... ok wot bout<span style="color: red;"> </span>bedroom setup?</b><br>
<br>
rich: gone now, just buchla 400 in there at the mo but was super top to 
have a great setup in bedroom again, doing tracks in the nude, y -fronts
 etc<br>
<br>
<b>dave: yea bedroom setups have certain vibe... big room?</b><br>

2008. the synthi 100 woz in there + arp2500 + loada more klobbage! u not
 sent me a samp of the synthi100 yet tho. ok, c-shape</b><br>
<br>
rich: cray setup in the big room, headphones only, although got lush 
little geithain monitors in there now which im well happy with, no 
subbass though, disklavier, more modulars,midi pipe organs, snr2[at the 
mo], synclav, dk synergy! dx1 etc etc defender tabletop :)<br>
<br>
<b>dave: can;t wait 2 hear some o tht! that stuff not on this album ? + 
really wanna chk the synclav &amp; synergy out nex time i'm over. lodge?</b><br>

rich: took me 3 years to mke this one, had to have help to solder in the
 patch bay as there about 4000connections, currently trying to stop 
super clever mice eating the cables, its in the woods.<br>
got some hydra phonic aux sends :)<br>
<br>
<b>dave: have brief recollections of tht place, we staggered out there 
one day in 08, seem to remem it got dark and we had hek of job finding 
our way bk coz we didn;t take a torch...<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>i'm assumin this is tht place we went ??</b><br>
<br>
rich: yes! i quite often forget torch and either hold on to my german 
sheppard or feel my way home , no light pollution up there, I'm sure 
your place gets ultra dark when its cloudy?<br>
I don't like that about cities, no proper darkness outside.<br>
<br>

yer face, conversely when its full moon dont even need a torch! mod

<br>
<b>dave: :) as well as the yamaha fm stuff, u seem to have a lotta love 
for the sh101 + roland klobbage, can u tell me why u like this lovely 
little synth, how many u used &amp; mebbe summat bout the other roland 
klob listed/unlisted? + also defo tell me bout the TR666.</b><br>
<br>
rich: my first analogue synth, its prob the most digital sounding 
analogue synth there is ,as ultra stable, clean sounding, thin but i 
love them for their simplicity and sound<br>
but wow intellijel atlantis, sh101 and then some and some more! ok 
without sequencer and mod grip :), maybe they should do them in red and 
blue also,<br>
4x101's for polyphinc 101 is pretty amazing also<br>
love the square wave on the sub osc forever, could go on about them for ages...<br>
they mod extremely well but then you lose the simplicity, its interesting.<br>
I had a dream once about this ultra 101 with big LCD display in the 
middle...im that sad, actually no fuck it that was a lush dream and it 
had a roland 404 in it which got released in another dimension which was
 combo of sh101 and 909, i made a tracks on them, and they sounded so 
beautiful , the memory of that dream, the sound of the 404 is still with
 me , a big influence, i try to make sounds like it made in this dream a
 lot.<br>
<br>
<b>dave: + anyting u can say on TR666?</b><br>
<br>
rich: a lush guy in london made it, i gotta attach a pic, I've seen a 
lot of 606's modified but not like this baby, you can do whole tracks on
 it , with all the cv's ins,<br>
you can tune all the oscillators on it,8 of em for the cymbals/hihats.<br>

<br>
<b>dave: looking at the klob list I think the sound devices 722 was

traks into it, or was it for field/wildlife/acoustic/on-location 
recordings etc?</b><br>
<br>
rich: record tracks to it, its really handy for that , for all the diff 
setups +it records to CF and hard drive simultaneously so backed up from
 the start and apart from tape and stuff i do itb keeps my stuff kind of
 in the same place<br>
<br>
<b>dave:care to share any modular experiments, any buchla maybe?</b><br>
<br>
rich: Yeah sure, what to attach....hmmm ok these are made from a very 
rare buchla"10 partial &amp; filter generator" , i think there are only 1
 or 2 in existence!<br>
made these 2 about 12 years ago, fuk, seems like yesterday...3rd &amp;4th are all serge,<br>

<b>dave: wow, great stuff, thats a whole bunch of top modular racketing!
 hey that reminds me, ow's the System 700?! i rem u showing it me when i
 came over before i came to oz, first time i'd ever seen one in the 
flesh.</b><br>
<br>
rich: ok fuk, now were really talking, I mean as far as analogue synths 
go, all you really need is a system700, If I had to keep only one synth 
it would be that, absolutely the most beautifully designed synth of all 
time, it's the best for all the conventional type synth sounds, you can 
go weird on it but it really begs you to set it up and play it like a 
proper instrument.<br>
Its so inspiring to look at and use, system100m's are absolutely 
gorgeous but 700's sounds and look 4 times as good, and about tht many 
times heavier.<br>
Ive got 2 of the sequencers for it which are just ridiculous to look at, the size of them! and are actually pretty unique.<br>
Id take it over a fully loaded arp2500, although the arp 1047 filter is 
very special, evil purity or something..beats every eurorack filter so 
far..i think ur hinton filt might be based on it, looks kinda similar.<br>
<br>
But the sys700 has the right balance of pre patched connections and user
 config, so you don't always need a ton of cables to get basic sounds 
going, I hadnt switched mine on for about<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>5 years, was in storage, set it all up and all the oscillators tracked perfectly over pretty much the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>entire
 range! its the rolls royce of modulars, They obviously looked hard at 
the moog modular, tidied it right up and made it a lot more 
usable/playable, manual is super top also.<br>
will try and find some examples which just use it &amp;attach, Im going to be spending a whole lot more time from now on<br>
the expansion modules for it are just so good, and I really love the compact lab 700, synth porn at its most intense, so cute.<br>
ok inc tracks are straight out of sys700 to tape, just a taste from 1 
seshun when i 1st got it, not sure why i put em to tape on this one, i 
think i was going 4 human league style.<br>

<b>wot was the tiniest / littlest / shortest mini-snippet of sound on the album &amp; wot klob woz it off that klob list?</b><br>
<br>
rich: ha, musicmaid claptraps :)<br>
<br>
<b>dave: on a scale of 0 to ultra-rare the rmi harmonic synth is pretty 
ultra-rare, how did u find get hold of it, wot u rek to it &amp; how did
 u use it? </b><br>
<br>
rich: they r a freakout, really early digital synth in a world of its 
own, its unbelievably nicen crunchy, i love the stereo aspect of it as 
you can get the same sound in both channels but detune the harmonics in 
one channel, the sync is the best thing about it, its a bit of a 3 trik 
pony for the size but good trix, plus best buttons in universe, not got 
it anymore though.<br>
<br>
<b>dave: its amazing how the tactile aspect can really make a difference sometimes init... </b><br>

<b>she sez tht eventide wrote to her to tell her they fixed the glitch 
on the 910 harmonizer and she said "but the glitch is the most beautiful
 thing about it".</b><br>
<br>
rich: ha yeah that wot i would have said.<br>
basically you wont both, same as h949, my fave fx unit but unfortunately
 but understandably the most unreliable and hardest bit of klob to 
break/fix.<br>
people are trying to sell them for loads but you need to go and pick 
them in person coz they so likely to either not work or break in the 
mail, only buy if you are a millionaire, I had to buy 10 to get 3 
working, i wanted 3 werking simult.<br>
<br>
ok m8 i need a breather... , we've nattered lots about me an me new syro
 album, now time for u to tell me few tings bout wot yer up to<br>
i rember being at the bar with u in a club in london on a rephresh nite 
bk in late90's &amp; u explaining&nbsp;2 me&nbsp;how&nbsp;you worked 
with cellular automata , drawing grids in beer all over the bar &amp; 
shuffling all the bottles &amp; glasses around!!! peepz lookin at us 
well weird., tell me bit bout tht as well. i rem when yer album 
generative compositions came out coz u came over to mine and we had a 
week long synth sesh! its well wikd album + &nbsp;i played a bit of it 
out when i dj'd with hecker. then u done tht automata von neuman series 
of course, so wots on the horizon m8, i know u've been well bizy coz 
u've maxed me up with plenny of soundfiles. + where u at with that 
radioactive synth module, the random events thing ??<br>

<b>me &amp; russell also held a modular synth workshop during this session which was very well received &amp; lots of fun!&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
<b>the second one on alku is a solo album called 'chaotic cellular 
drums' recorded between march &amp; may 2014, again using maniac 
cellular automata sequencer (this time using midi output to control midi
 based synth drum modules &amp; effects units, so sequencing effects 
with cellular automata as well). this album was recorded live to 2 &amp;
 4 track track, and was recorded as it happened, with some very minor 
editing on the odd track.&nbsp;</b><br>

<b>'16 x 16 cell meditations' was recorded using a bank of special 
microtonal oscillators i custom designed &amp; built. they are 
digital/microprocessor based &amp; fully temperature stable with a 
0.01hz resolution, so i can setup very precise microtonal intervals with
 them.&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
<b>i aint gunna reveal the full technique, as i;ve got a bunch of other 
microtonal meditation recordings using the same setup in the pipeline 
that i want to put out first. since i;ve been meditating &amp; doing 
qigong, i've really noticed how ultracrap a lot of "meditation music " 
is... well &nbsp;i dont reckon there is anything much, but of course tho
 i really &nbsp;like eliane radigue, pauline oliveros, laurie spiegel, 
their music is great!! &nbsp;&amp; maybe few others...&nbsp;actually my 
favourite laurie spiegel tracks of all time, AND pretty much my all time
 fave electronic music trax of all time are <i>Improvisation on a "Concerto Generator"</i> (1977) made on the Bell Labs Alles digital synth (which also got fm in it!) &amp; <i>Immersion</i>
 (1983) done on the McLeyvier computer-controlled analog synthesis music
 system. everytime i hear em its like there's a super intelligent being 
imparting some deep wisdom with a massive smile :) she was totally on 
the case with algorithmic/generative music !! ++ i really like all the 
papers she wrote too. landmark inspirational stuff for me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><br>

<b>which woz a kinda pre-curser to my current batch of microtonal 
electronic drone meditation trax, one was on an sy99 &amp; other was on 
the hinton music lab (with its oscillators not my ones).&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
<b>basically tho, the electronic drone meditation stuff i'm doing is not
 a million miles from the "binaural&nbsp;beats" / brain entrainment type
 meditation stuff, but it is very different sound &amp; process wise ...
 it is NOT a rehash of that stuff. u can use my meditation trax as a 
focus object or just as tune out listening, which i dont fink u can 
really do wiv&nbsp;binaural&nbsp;beats, not the stuff i;ve heard + mine

<b>&amp; a soundart project with schoolkids (which is part of 
australia's national science week), using the arduino based bare

be getting with the school curriculum. keep checking me blog &amp; the 
wired lab site as we'll be announcing the wired lab stuff soon.</b><br>
<br>
rich: 4sure, ok wot else, wot bout yer dsp experiments??<br>
<br>
<b>dave: i've got a new dsp box on the go, been having a full on dsp 
frenzy this year. its pretty advanced this one compared to me old one 
(even tho the old one does stuff this one doesn;t), &amp; its got a 
multi channel i/o + spdif + cv interface. i'm collating bunch of 
recordings i've been working on with my old 90's dsp box, like the one u
 got off me, so using that process and other tingz.</b><br>
<br>
rich: still havnt found it, its here somewhere, i hope. tht bitspeak 
plugin i was tellin u about is Vgood, im sure loads of people will jump 
on that .<br>
<br>
<b>dave: nothing available yet tho, very much in progress... so no idea 
when i;ll get round to puttin tht out. i been doing some code / hardware
 updates to the old dsp box, so its now got an 8 bit logic buss so i can
 direct interface to CA modules, drive it from the cells, + this bus 
&nbsp;works all the way up to super quick at the sample clock rate, up 
to 44.1 &amp; 48 khz. i checked out the bitspeak site, yea interesting, 
hah! they copying me!! :) anyway, guaranteed their software will sound a
 bit different to my hardware dsp box. even more definite is that mine 
will distort / deteriote / fuckup in a totally different way to their 
software. </b><br>
<br>
rich: glad u keeping up the dsp action, looking 4wd to chk that stuff. i
 rem u sayin u had some full on ca microtuning epiphany last year!<br>
<br>
<b>dave: yea, my other major breakthru last year was getting cellular 
automata to create self organising / generative 
microtunings.&nbsp;&nbsp;u've heard some of the recordings already of 
course via email, but i;ve not published any of these yet.&nbsp;i've 
been trying to figure a way of doing this for many years, but i finally 
cracked it last year (actually some of the conversations u &amp; i had 
over email were very useful in getting this method going, made me 
re-visit a few things i'd previously checked out, but not actively 
followed up). the CA microtuning method is not based totally on music 
theory tho. the way i approached it was getting the CA to create its own
 tuning systems, so its a lot more alien, more like artificial brains 
making their own&nbsp;freaky&nbsp;tunings. i'll prob b making this 
tuning method public at some point, because no one else has done CA 
based microtunings, so its quite an exciting development for my CA work,
 finally closing the gap from synthesis / sequencing / control.&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
rich: wot bout yer hermiting lifestyle mode ??<br>
<br>
<b>dave: regarding hermit mode, i always been like that :) + it helped 
with the cloak &amp; dagger stuff :) in 90's lotta peeps used to call me
 "virtual dave" or "virtual noyze" or just "virtual" ... quite funny... i
 hardly used to leave me studio, except to go to labs, go for for walks,
 go to pub &amp; come &amp; contribute with the video projectin at some 
of the rephlex gigs, which was lot of fun! when i was a young kid they 
used to call me "hypothermia" coz i used to always b inside (especially 
in summer coz of my terrible hay fever!), and there was this public 
service ad on the telly which had some old age pensioner sat in a chair 
with a book with no heating getting hypothermia, weird how tht was how i
 appeared to others at tht age... so i jus been building up an archive 
of recordings / experiments / machines over the years tht i'm finally 
starting to make a bit more well known thanks to your (&amp; bunch other
 peeps) badgering, and a few obliging/understanding labels + me missus 
(sarah last, wired lab curator) is always keen for me to get me work out
 &amp; more widely accessible + we collaborate on stuff as well.&nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
rich: yea didnt you an yer missus win some top ozzie experiMENTAL arts award for that piano drag piece?<br>
<br>
<b>dave: yea, well it was 2 awards wired lab won for a project sarah 
curated called southern encounter &amp; piano drag was part of it. was 
great to finally realise that piece after many years of trying to get a 
train &amp; track to do it on. we finally did it on a private track in 
south australia in 2012, and we were pulled by a steam train &amp; 
buncha carriages. basically we attached a piano to the back of a train, 
and had it contact mic'd up , like about 16 contact mics i designed and 
built, and fed em to this big analogue mixer. so i mixed it live (no fx)
 at EARSPLITTING volume ! sarah said b4 hand she wanted it to be really 
confronting, it was... some bloke started screaming at me to stop during
 the performance so i jus thrashed it up even more!, they had to take 
him off the train when we detached the remains of the piano coz he 
fainted or passed out somehow, couldn;t handle it ... we projected the 
video of its destruction in realtime into the roofs of the carriages. it
 was a comment on european colonization of australia, and was bookended 
with the local Indigenous Ngarrindjeri Rritjarukar Choir singing in 
their traditional language that i recorded with them in a local church. 
they gave us permission to use their songs &amp; performance for the 
piece. whole thing was just very raw... it was sarah's concept initially
 &amp; we developed it together, very emotional piece... we been invited
 to show it internationally, which is very hard coz we need a train 
&amp; a track to do it on! i gotta little excerpt of it on vid that the 
conductor took out the back of the train in south australia, chk it out!
 i'd love to do it with a full size concert grand piano.</b><br>

<b>dave: i've managed to stay as a bit of an obscure outsider &amp; 
mainly been distributing my music privately between friends/contacts. 
had a few interesting offers over the years from labels to put my 
recorded work out, but not really followed it up, been having too much 
fun in me secret soundlab &amp; doing live / art events. u know... crazy
 stuff like working with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141110222421/https://bradbury.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">garry bradbury</a>
 on an artwork called 'pi scraper' which was setup on a huge 100ft 
railway turntable. we contact mic up and play/mix live from the 
turntable as it spins. proper industrial techno! we also use a couple of
 massive piezo styli that are attached to the turntable, which play the 
concrete ground, like a record player.... very grainy &amp; harsh, but 
surpisingly eerily choral at the same time, weird... a mix of 'pi 
scraper' ended up in the wire magazine. we had the whole thing video'd

<b>be really good to put couple of mixes of that out on vinyl 12" + be 
great to do some more live shows with that piece as well. need a proper 
railway roundhouse for it tho! </b><br>
<br>
<b>things r beginning to change these last few years in terms of putting
 out albums, which i;m quite into doing, espesh since doing me phd, 
where i was basically given total freedom to do wot i wanted, which was 
really an amazing opportunity to work within academia tht way, i.e. not 
doing someone else's bidding, but really getting to develop my work 
&amp; ideas. thats where the main chunk of my cellular automata research
 ended up. at first it was going to be about all my 
algorithmic/generative work and how it relates to my music, but u have 
to focus for a phd, so i decided to make it just about the cellular 
automata work, and in particular on a discovery i made about cellular 
automata rule space that was supposed to be impossible... </b><br>
<br>
<b>in fact it was my 2nd attempt at a phd. i did get started on a secret
 one for telecom in the 90's when i was at the labs, but i ended up 
shelving that, did get some bits declassified &amp; published as a 
couple of scientific papers from it tho, which were on spatial 
audio/reverb for teleconferencing in virtual reality / artificial life 
environments. &nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
rich: wot bout tht radioactive synth module, you're really go off on one with that !!<br>
<br>
<b>dave: tht radioisotope random event generator module i'm workin on is
 comin on well... i got 2 lab grade radioisotope disc sources buzzin 
away, a beta &amp; a gamma source. i got little page ere</b><br>

rich: oh yea, got them trax,i like playing them both at the same time 
out multiple speakers REALLY FUCKIN LOUD!!! my neighbours thought a 
nuclear war had started! they all got freaked out!<br>
<br>
<b>dave: well i need some more time on the radioactive module (well 
would like more time on all me modules hah!) + when i get an alpha 
radioisotope source it gotta b timed right coz the half life on them is 
really short, so need to make sure have block of time allocated. the 
alpha discs are made from polonium-210, which only got a 138 day half 
life. well actually the gamma source, cobalt-60, &nbsp;aint terribly 
long half life either at 5.27 years, so my one will b gettin to its 
first half life soon. here is a couple of bonus pics of it during the 
testing stage, bit tricky to work with coz have to hold em with tongs or
 pliers at arms length, i built it in an old 300baud modem case. </b><br>

<br>
<b>+ have to make sure i got a little special place setup coz its 
radioactive, so can;t jus leave em lying about... i made me own special 
lead housing for em for shielding, u can get specially made up ones as 
well. funnily enuff the commercial ones are called LSD which stands for 
lead shielded disc. also coz i live up in the hills where there's lots 
of massive granite boulders &nbsp;i got plenty of natural background 
radiation to play with as well. i'm really into radioactive things, such
 a great source of real world "true" randomness &amp; its around us 
everywhere, theres no such thing as a nuclear free zone! i reckon every 
synth should have a 'radioactive' nuclear hardware section, u know like 
there's osc, filter, noise, adsr, lfo etc.. they should just add another
 bit in there for fully random radioactive action! they should power em 
from little mini radioisotopes, like them little tiny spacecraft do, get
 the tek down to prosumer grade!</b><br>
<br>
rich: the eurocrack bods should license some of your module designs! 
like ca, chaos, mudley talker, microtonal osc etc. i'd buy em!<br>
<br>
<b>dave: be really cool if some of the eurorack manufacturers licensed 
some of my module designs, had a few enquiries but nothin happening 
yet... i'm well into it. my modules have totally flumoxed peeps over the
 years, coz no-one else got anyting like em, they're not a rehash of the
 same old standard modular synth circuits like lotta peeps make. but 
that has also made things tough coz it was hard for folks to get their 
heads round it. people are gettin bit more sophisticated these days tho 
which is really good, and now lotta peeps are getting into 
algorithmic/generative + chaotic &amp; complex systems in the 
modular/synth world. there's still a massive gap between wots possible 
&amp; wot is available commercially... some interesting stuff coming out
 tho. the radioactive ones r bit hard tho, as anything commercial made 
with radioactive stuff inside needs special license, do-able tho, jus 
bit more red tape required. b good to do an album tht comes with a 
radioactive disc source, then anyone can play with em :)</b><br>
<br>
rich: wicked! i jus spotted on automata 52 sleeve notes the 'watch that 
sprouts watches' trk also used your old synton syntovox 221! how did u 
use it?<br>
<br>
<b>dave: tht bit was recorded in 96, used the roland system 100m thru 
it, so its the main hypnotic synth riff in the trk. got a whole stack of
 recordings of 100m thru the synton in me archive tht were done bak 
then, they seemed to have a really good affinity towards each other, 
espesh coz the synton got its own unique sound + i rek the way can 
overdrive the synton has cool sound which adds even more to it, wow i 
soooo miss my old one... synton should start remaking that!!! one of the
 all time best non-classified lab vocoders for surely with top 
secret-twiddler rear panel interface... ok speedy j, if you're reading 
this, i really want to get my synton back!:)</b><br>
<br>
rich: ok madman, tell me more bout how u have used the synton!!??<br>
<br>
<b>dave: well even tho you're still badgering me to write more, which 
i;d love to do, i rek i should leave it till u interview me for now 
(well i'll tell ya over email as well anyway:), and lets get bak to your
 stuff and get this interview wrapped up so we can get back to playin on
 synths! &nbsp;</b><br>
<br>
rich: looking forward to chekin all tht new stuff out!!<br>
<br>
<b>dave: we've chatted b4 fair bit bout nutty fx/dsp units &amp; 
eventide in particular, so much so u convinced me to go an get some 
eventide klob an i luv em! + it gave me a new take on approaching my 
music work. u mentioned to me b4 tht the h3000 has a special something u
 like, can u say summink bout tht? its prob early days, but how much of 
sound difference do u notice between the new eventide h8000 and the 
older ones (h3000 dse / dsp 4000) and wot can u say bout tht / &amp; 
eventide klob generally?</b><br>
<br>
rich: its a bit early for me to say but ask me again in a few months as im on all those hard at the mo<br>
4000 i know well and made quite few of my own algos on it.<br>
3000 has something amazing though that few things can touch, i mean just
 the digital filters on it are insane, engineers must have been on fire 
when they made that thing.<br>
not enough midi controllable parameters on it though<br>
<br>
<b>dave: any piece of klob I aint mentioned tht u used on this album that u particularly would like to say somtin bout?</b><br>

rich: Yes many, not properly mixed down though but heres a couple for 
starters! this was the very first rhythmic tryouts, they got better 
before the sofware crashed, next time i will nail the bugger! 2nd is 
rehearsal for orc version of a saw2 track that never got 
performed...backwards..I really need to mixdown the others as they 
friggin amazing if i dont mind saying so myself, esp krakow pendulum 
piece which turned out way beyond my highest expectations, i felt god or
 someone was helping me out there, maybe it was just my amazing crew!<br>

	I got kicked out of that little one with the pedals in the window on totenham court road by the bus stop, SO many times…<br>
	Then one day when i had moved to london, when I was about 25, I went 
down in the basement in it and they had a roland 100m fully loaded, I 
think it was around £200, maybe less, I couldn’t believe it I thought it
 was a joke, I bought it immediately but looked as unexcited as 
possible, I was soooo nervous, the guy who owned that shop was the worst
 cunt of the lot and he didnt remember me from when i was little kicking
 me out of there.,<br>
	I just couldnt belive this tight fisted bugger didnt know what it was 
but he didnt! hahaaha, I thought this was top karma…then when i went 
back in there<br>
	couple weeks later he had a go at me! even better,! he was like you 
knew that synth was worth more didn’t you! ha i was like tuff fucking 
titites mate! bye!<br>
	so thats how i got my 1st 100m...<br>
	anyway vcs3 was sitting there, id never seen anything like that before,
 I was afraid to touch it looked so alien and utterly amazing.,.<br>
	SO then sometime after I realised ems was in cornwall AND about an hour from my house!!! I thought ok this is destiny.<br>
	so I got my dad to drive me over there, I was there so long , my dad 
was getting annoyed but I spent all the money I had buying a synthi A, 
grey case for £800 !, what they worth now , like 7k or summink??!!<br>
	I really wanted the sequencer one but didn’t have enough money, so 
robin sold me the ‘a’ for £800 then the best bit i drove off with it so 
excited with my dad, got to end of the tiny lane he lived down realised i
 left the power cable at robin's [not an iec cable] so i was like dad 
please, we gotta go back,my dad was getting so annoy ed by now..so we 
were driving back and I thought I bet he comes driving after us max 
speed coz nobody lives down this lane and just then he came around 
corner and smacked into my dads car !<br>
	but the funniest bit he held his hand out the window proudly displaying the power lead ! ha so good.<br>
	my dad was not happy, was quite a prang…so embarassing.had to 
smile..was a good way to robin to remember..he couldn’t forget that!<br>
	Anyway so yeah I had a synthi a when i was 18/19 and nobody I knew even
 knew wot a synth was , none of my mates and they were like what the 
fuck is that thing, i used to patch it up and leave it running while we 
smoked it up, many a time…<br>
	I learned that synth so well, its such a good synth to get when u havnt
 got much else, so many tricks you can do on them…and since then I’ve 
played on a  silver later aks one and have to say my beige one sounds 
WAY better, I think its pretty early, it actually says serial no1 on 
mine but im sure that cant b right…not checked with robin yet, so u 
never know!<br>
	got one of these recently but have not had time 2 go thru it yet, but it looks soooo good, steve thomas is a top dude!<br>

	<b>dave: :) ok, thanks ever so much for this MEGA! interview, u've been
 really generous with your time+info. its been great going over all this
 stuff...anything you would like to end on, parting message?<br>
	</b>
<br>
	rich: Yes well it will have to be something not to do with equipment &amp; music, as that's enough of that for now.<br>
	
<br>
	
I'd like for the people to put their differences aside in the coming 
years and unite to change the brutal system we are all currently being 
controlled under. I think things are going to get ruff in the next few 
years but i'm extremely optimistic that if people stick together we can 
peacefully change the terrible system that has currently got us by the 
balls.<br>
	
Will we end up with another version of the same thing, lets make sure that doesnt happen.<br>
	
The only way theruling rich elite can keep us where they want and take 
even more of our civil liberties away is by dividing us and keep us 
fighting each other.<br>
	
it's wakey wakey time everyone! Don't be fooled by the mass media.<br>
	 <br>
</p>
<p>eat well, don't be afraid, stay positive, love,learn&amp;create.<br>

		<b>dave: ok, so finally don’t you feel a bit guilty about pretending to be richard for this interview!?<br>
		</b><br>
		rich: nah, rich asks me or couple of his other friends to do most of 
his press for him , don’t think he did any this time around!<br>
		i’ve done several email interviews for him in the past, so im used to 
it, he always says to say whatever the fuck you like and not even sure 
if he reads them, he usually gives me some good freebies, I got copy 02 
of the Syro limited edition this time, which should be worth a few quid!<br>
